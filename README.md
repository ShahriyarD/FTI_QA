Here we revisit quantum annealing using ferromagnetic transverse interaction. While the minimum gap using this algorithm also seems to be exponentially decreasing (a major generic hurdle for quantum annealing) the extent of its advantage as well as the degrees at which in certain cases it beats the conventional quantum annealing call for further investigation. This notebook is meant to provide a starting point for such endeavors.
